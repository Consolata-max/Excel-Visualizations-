# Excel-Visualizations-
Got curious about visualizations in excel and here is what I came up with on one weekend 

# Introduction
According to (Yalcin et al, 2016, p.86-95) data exploration involves the formation of analysis goals, planning of actions, identification of outliers in data and effective evaluation of results to identify the relationships between the different data variables. It also ensures that the results produced are valid and applicable to any desired business outcomes and goals. Data Exploration Analysis also helps stakeholders by confirming they are asking the right questions. For this exploratory task, The Netflix titles November 2019 dataset on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivamb/netflix-shows-and-movies-exploratory-analysis/data will be our focus for this specific analysis. The dataset consists of details about movies and TV shows such as cast, release year, rating and duration. Due to my love for movies, I selected this dataset to get some insights on my favorite movie stars, the number of shows theyâ€™ve featured on, and which show ranks highest in terms of rating. The selected data had some missing values on the director, cast, country, date added and rating columns. The missing values can be filled using Imputation which works to correct missing values by filling in with values using various methods.

# Investigative Questions 
## Which content type is most popular?
This question would help a user decide on whether to sign up for a subscription if the preferred content type is the most available on the platform. It would also give the Netflix management team a great view of the available content type on the platform and make better decisions on which content type to add or reduce.

## Which country provides the largest amount of content?
This would greatly help the management make decisions on which region to increase the content production and useful to users to view the variety of content available from the different countries. It would also help a user view whether the preferred content from a specific country is available. An example would be a user from Mexico checking to see if they have Mexican shows on Netflix. 

## Which is the most popular genre?
The findings from this question would help users view where their preferred genre is ranked based on user ratings while giving management an easy time in identifying which genre they need to invest more or improve on the quality of the content being released.

## Who is the most popular director?
This would give users a great view on the list of directors with the most titles which may also lead to user interest in the directorâ€™s work. In the event that management would like to award the directors based on the number of titles this visualization would make it much easier to get this visualization.

## Which TV Rating has the highest number of titles?
This visualization would help management identify the areas to increase their type of content in order to cater for all their audiences especially children. It would also help parents / guardians make a choice of paying for the subscription based on whether it caters fully for the entertainment needs of the household members without compromising on moral values.

# Data Interpretations 
The data interpretations to the questions above are in the excel sheet associated with this repo

# Lessons Learnt 
For further analysis of the data to yield more accurate results, Iâ€™d use advanced methods such as Box Plot, Scatter plot, Z-score and IQR (Inter-Quartile Range) to aid in the detection and handling of the outliers in data. This would lead to conclusive results as the null values would be taken care of. Iâ€™d also come up with assumptions that I can use as test cases in comparison to the actual results of the analysis.  

# Conclusion
Hoping to do more visualizations with slightly complex excel formulas. Loved working with the dataset ðŸ˜Š
